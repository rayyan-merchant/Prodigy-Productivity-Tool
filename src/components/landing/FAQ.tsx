      question: "How does the Pomodoro technique work?",
      answer: "The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as 'pomodoros'. After four pomodoros, you take a longer break of about 15-30 minutes."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the timer duration?",
      answer: "Yes, you can customize both work and break durations in the settings. The default is 25 minutes for work and 5 minutes for breaks, but you can adjust these based on your preferences."
